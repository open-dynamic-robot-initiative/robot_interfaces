Desired vs Applied Action
=========================

The action given by the user is called the *desired* action.  Depending on the
implementation of the @ref robot_interfaces::RobotDriver, this action may be
altered before it is actually applied on the robot, e.g. by some safety checks
limiting torque and maximum velocity.  This altered action is called the
*applied* action.  You can use
@ref robot_interfaces::RobotFrontend::get_applied_action to see what action
actually got applied on the robot.
